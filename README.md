JSChip8
====================

 Hi there! This is a javacript emulator of the interpreted language CHIP-8. It runs directly in the web browser and you can emulate it online. Coding emulators is a great way of learning how the computer works, so I started learning it recently. It is basically a virtual machine that emulates a virtual circuit of the CHIP-8 machine. You can find out more in this technical reference: http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#2.2
